## Testing

The project uses the [MSTest framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/quick-start-test-driven-development-with-test-explorer) for testing the converter.

It is setup with two tests; one for setting up the API by registering the client to your WATS, and one for running the converter.

The values are hardcoded in the test, so you will need to change the values to reflect your setup.
* In SetupClient, fill in your information in the the call to RegisterClient.
* In TestConverter, fill in the path to the file you want to test the converter with. There are example files in the Examples folder.
* Run SetupClient once, then you can run TestConverter as many times as you want.
